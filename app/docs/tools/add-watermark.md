# Add Watermark

Add text or image watermarks to your PDF pages using a visual editor. You can position the watermark by dragging it directly on the preview, resize it with corner handles, and configure opacity, rotation, font, and color. Each page can have its own watermark position, or you can apply the same watermark to all pages at once.

## How It Works

1. Upload your PDF file.
2. The editor opens with a live preview of the first page and a draggable watermark overlay.
3. Choose between **Text** or **Image** watermark mode using the toggle buttons.
4. Configure the watermark settings in the sidebar panel.
5. Drag the watermark on the preview to position it exactly where you want it. Use the corner handles to resize.
6. Navigate between pages to set per-page watermarks, or keep **Apply to all pages** checked.
7. Click **Add Watermark** to process and download.

## Options

**Text watermark settings:**

- **Text** -- The watermark text (e.g., "CONFIDENTIAL", "DRAFT").
- **Font Size** -- From 10 to 200 points. Defaults to 72.
- **Color** -- Any color via the color picker.
- **Opacity** -- Control transparency from fully transparent to fully opaque.
- **Rotation** -- Rotate the watermark text from -180 to 180 degrees.

**Image watermark settings:**

- **Image Upload** -- Upload a PNG, JPG, or other image file to use as the watermark.
- **Opacity** -- Control image transparency.
- **Scale** -- Resize the image watermark.

**Layout settings:**

- **Single** -- One watermark per page, positioned by dragging or with the position presets.
- **Tiled** -- Repeats the watermark across the whole page in a diagonal grid that follows the rotation angle, so the mark covers the document from edge to edge.
- **Horizontal gap** -- Spacing between tiles along the text direction, as a percentage of the watermark width (tiled mode only).
- **Vertical gap** -- Spacing between tile rows, as a percentage of the watermark height (tiled mode only).

**General settings:**

- **Apply to all pages** -- When checked, the same watermark applies to every page. Uncheck to set individual watermarks per page.
- **Page Range** -- Specify which pages get the watermark (e.g., "1-3, 5, 7-9" or "all").

## Tips

- For diagonal watermarks across the page, set a rotation around 45 degrees and increase the font size.
- Tiled mode makes a document much harder to reuse after cropping, since removing one mark still leaves dozens behind. Lower the opacity when tiling so the underlying text stays readable.
- Image watermarks with transparent backgrounds (PNG format) blend more naturally with the document content.
- If you need different watermark text on different pages, uncheck "Apply to all pages" and navigate page by page.
