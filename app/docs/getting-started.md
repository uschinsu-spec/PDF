# Getting Started

Welcome to BentoPDF! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## What is BentoPDF?

BentoPDF is a free, open-source, privacy-first PDF toolkit that runs **entirely in your browser**. Your files never leave your device—all processing happens locally using WebAssembly (WASM) technology.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Hosted Version

Visit [bentopdf.com](https://bentopdf.com) to use BentoPDF instantly—no installation required.

### Option 2: Self-Host with Docker

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Office file conversion requires `SharedArrayBuffer`, which needs both:
>
> - `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
> - `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`
> - a secure context
>
> `http://localhost` works for local testing because browsers treat loopback as trustworthy. `http://192.168.x.x` or other LAN IPs usually do not, so Word/Excel/PowerPoint conversions will require HTTPS when accessed from other devices on your network.

```bash
# Pull and run the Docker image (self-hosted build)
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 ghcr.io/alam00000/bentopdf-simple:latest

# Or use Docker Compose
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alam00000/bentopdf/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

> [!TIP]
> BentoPDF ships in two builds: the **Self-Hosted build** (`bentopdf-simple`, used above) for internal/team/organization deployments, and the **Commercial build** (`bentopdf:latest`) used by bentopdf.com itself and by commercial license holders running public-facing deployments. Both ship the same PDF tools — the Commercial build adds the bentopdf.com hero, FAQ, testimonials, and footer. If in doubt, use the Self-Hosted build.

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are preparing an air-gapped OCR deployment, you must host the OCR text-layer fonts internally in addition to the Tesseract worker, core runtime, and traineddata files. The full setup is documented in [Self-Hosting](/self-hosting/), including `VITE_OCR_FONT_BASE_URL` and the bundled `ocr-fonts/` directory.

### Option 3: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alam00000/bentopdf.git
cd bentopdf

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
